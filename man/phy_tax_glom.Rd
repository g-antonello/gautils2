\title{Agglomerate at higher taxonomic rank/level}
\usage{
phy_tax_glom(physeq, level, make.unique = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{The taxonomic rank to aggregate at. Make sure it matches exactly the column name in the taxonomy table (see \code{rank_names(physeq)})}

\item{make.unique}{whether you should make unique the names. Default is \code{FALSE}. The standard separation pattern is \code{_.}}

\item{phy}{A \code{phyloseq} object}
}
\description{
Function that wraps speedyseq's tax_glom function and renames taxa based on more readable names as seen in the taxonomy table
}
\examples{

library(gautils2)
data("GlobalPatterns")
gp_Family <- phy_tax_glom(GlobalPatterns, "Family", make.unique = FALSE)
# this code shoots a "duplicated names" error. But you can make these names unique artificially:

gp_Family <- phy_tax_glom(GlobalPatterns, "Family", make.unique = TRUE)

}
